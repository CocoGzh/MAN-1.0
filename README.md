## Overview
Background: 
The explosive growth of genomic, chemical, and pathological data provides new opportunities and challenges
for humans to thoroughly understand life activities in cells. However, there exist few computational models that 
aggregate various bioentities to comprehensively reveal the physical and functional landscape of biological systems. 

Results: We constructed a molecular association network, which contains 18 edges (relationships) between 8 nodes 
(bioentities).

## Doc
The edges and nodes can be found in the above files.
